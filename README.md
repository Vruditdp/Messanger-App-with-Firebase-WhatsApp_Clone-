# WhatsApp_Clone
Clone of WhatsApp in terms of UI and core functionality. The App was developed in Android (Java).

In this project, I have made a clone of WhatsApp Messanger in Android using Java. 
I have made exactly same UI and basic functionality of real WhatsApp.
I just wanted to get familiar with Android Technology, Thus I decided to take on project in Android and spend my some time on it.
Some unique features of my project are as below:
    # SignIn and SignUp using OTP, Mobile Number and E-Mail.
    # Live Chat
    # Photos can be send in Chat
    # We can also put Profile photo
    # We can find friends and send friend request to user of this app
    # You can find .apk file at "WhatsApp16\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk" and also install in your smartphone 
    # This app uses Firebase as database that is more reliable and stable.
